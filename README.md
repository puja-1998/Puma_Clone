2.Clean, responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
3.Mobile-first approach with Tailwind's utility-first classes.
4.Fast load times and minimalist aesthetic.

Installation

Prerequisites

1.A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
2.Text editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)

Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/puja-1998/Puma_Clone

2.Navigate into the project directory:
cd puma_clone

3.Open index.html in your browser to view the project:

Usage

Example of Web Page Structure:
This simple project displays a server status page with:

1.A heading for the server name.
2.A status message indicating whether the server is running or down.
3.A button to refresh the server status.

Styling with Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The design is minimalist and fully responsive, meaning it works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Tailwind's utility-first classes allow for rapid development with minimal custom CSS.

To update or change the styling, modify the index.html file directly using Tailwind’s utility classes or extend the default theme by adding custom styles in a tailwind.config.js file (if needed for more advanced customizations).

Customization

If you wish to make adjustments to the appearance or functionality, you can:

Modify the classes in the HTML file to change layout, colors, and spacing.
Add custom fonts by linking Google Fonts or adding a @font-face in the <head> section.
Update the page’s title and other metadata as needed for your project.
